                    1. Schedule Slippage: With only 6 weeks remaining in a
                    3-month timeline, the project is at its halfway point, but
                    development is only 30% complete. This indicates a
                    significant deviation from the planned velocity, making it
                    highly likely the project will not be finished on time.

                    2. Budget Overrun: If the schedule slips, the cost of the
                    7-person team will extend beyond the planned 3-month
                    timeline, consuming more than the allocated $500K budget.

                    3. Scope Reduction: To meet the aggressive 6-week deadline,
                    there is a high risk that features will need to be cut, as
                    completing the remaining 70% of development in half the
                    project's timeline is improbable. The fact that design is
                    not yet 100% complete further complicates this.

                    Risk 1: Schedule Slippage. The project is 50% through its
                    timeline (6 of 12 weeks) but development is only 30%
                    complete, indicating a high likelihood of missing the launch
                    date.

                    - Probability: High

                    - Impact: Critical


                    Risk 2: Budget Overrun. The schedule slippage will require
                    developers and designers to be on the project longer than
                    the planned 3 months, consuming the budget at an
                    unsustainable rate.

                    - Probability: High

                    - Impact: Critical


                    Risk 3: Rework due to Unfinished Design. With design at 80%
                    completion, the final 20% could introduce changes that
                    require modification to the 30% of development work already
                    completed, causing further delays.

                    Risk 1: Schedule Slippage

                    Probability: High

                    Impact: Critical

                    Mitigation Strategies: Immediately re-scope the project to a
                    Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the initial launch,
                    deferring non-essential features to a post-launch update.
                    Evaluate adding a contract developer to augment the team for
                    the remainder of the project. Implement daily stand-up
                    meetings to track progress on development tasks against the
                    remaining 6-week timeline.


                    Risk 2: Rework Due to Incomplete Design

                    Probability: High

                    Impact: Major

                    Mitigation Strategies: Freeze the design scope immediately
                    for the version 1 launch. Prioritize the completion of the
                    remaining 20% of design work on core MVP features only.
                    Embed designers with the development team to provide
                    real-time clarification and prevent developers from working
                    on assumptions.


                    Risk 3: Poor Product Quality

                    Probability: High

                    Impact: Critical

                    Mitigation Strategies: Protect time for quality assurance
                    (QA) and bug-fixing cycles; do not sacrifice these for
                    feature development. Automate testing where possible to
                    speed up regression checks. Explicitly document any
                    technical debt incurred to meet the deadline and create a
                    plan to address it immediately after launch.

                    Risk 1: Significant Schedule Slippage

                    Probability: High

                    Impact: Critical

                    Mitigation Strategy: Immediately re-scope the project to a
                    Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the initial launch. Defer
                    all non-essential features to a post-launch update.
                    Prioritize the remaining feature list and focus development
                    efforts exclusively on the core "must-have" functionality
                    required for launch. Authorize targeted overtime for the
                    development team on critical path items.


                    Risk 2: Budget Overrun

                    Probability: High

                    Impact: Major

                    Mitigation Strategy: Implement the MVP re-scoping to reduce
                    the total work hours required. Institute a strict change
                    control process requiring stakeholder sign-off for any
                    change that impacts cost or timeline. Re-forecast the budget
                    to completion based on the current velocity and communicate
                    the expected overrun to stakeholders proactively.


                    Risk 3: Incomplete Design Causing Rework

                    Probability: Medium

                    Impact: Major

                    Mitigation Strategy: Freeze the current design scope. Any
                    feature not 100% designed is automatically moved to the
                    post-launch backlog. Ensure the two designers remain fully
                    allocated to the project to provide immediate clarification
                    and support to the development team, preventing them from
                    becoming a bottleneck.


                    Recommendation: Conditional Go. The project should proceed
                    only if the mitigation strategies, particularly the
                    aggressive re-scoping to an MVP and a feature freeze, are
                    implemented immediately. Continuing on the current path
                    presents a near-certain risk of failure to meet the timeline
                    and budget.

                    Top 3 Risks


                    Risk 1: Schedule Slippage

                    Probability: High

                    Impact: Critical

                    Description: At the 50% point of the 3-month timeline (6
                    weeks remaining), development is only 30% complete. This
                    indicates a significant deviation from the planned velocity,
                    making the original launch date highly unlikely without
                    intervention.

                    Mitigation Strategies:

                    1. Immediately de-scope the launch to a Minimum Viable
                    Product (MVP) by re-prioritizing the feature backlog with
                    stakeholders.

                    2. Augment the development team with contract resources to
                    increase capacity and parallelize workstreams.

                    3. Implement daily stand-up meetings focused exclusively on
                    identifying and removing development blockers to accelerate
                    progress.


                    Risk 2: Budget Overrun

                    Probability: High

                    Impact: Critical

                    Description: The current development delay directly
                    threatens the $500K budget. Any schedule extension or
                    addition of resources to meet the deadline will incur costs
                    beyond the initial plan.

                    Mitigation Strategies:

                    1. Enforce a strict scope freeze on the defined MVP to
                    prevent any new work that would increase time and cost.

                    2. Re-forecast the budget based on the work required to
                    complete the MVP and present the updated financial outlook
                    to stakeholders immediately.

                    3. Reduce non-personnel costs by reviewing all
                    subscriptions, tools, and third-party services for potential
                    savings.
