                  content: 'The term ontology is a Modern Latin coinage, *ontologia*, created in
                    the 17th century. It is derived from two Ancient Greek
                    roots: *on* (ὄν), which is the present participle of the
                    verb *eînai* (εἶναι), meaning "to be," and its genitive form
                    *ontos* (ὄντος), meaning "of being" or "of that which is."
                    This is combined with the suffix *-logia* (-λογία), which
                    denotes "study of," "discourse," or "science." Therefore,
                    the literal etymological meaning of ontology is "the study
                    of being" or "the science of existence." The term was first
                    used in philosophical texts in the early 1600s and was later
                    popularized by the German philosopher Christian Wolff.'

                  content: The term ontology is derived from Ancient Greek. The prefix "onto-"
                    comes from the Greek ὄν (on), genitive ὄντος (ontos),
                    meaning "being" or "that which is." The suffix "-logy" comes
                    from the Greek -λογία (-logia), meaning "study of" or
                    "science of," which is derived from λόγος (logos), meaning
                    "word, reason, or discourse." Therefore, the etymology of
                    ontology is the "study of being" or the "science of
                    existence."

                    The term "ontology" is derived from two Greek roots.


                    The first part, "onto-", comes from the Greek word ὄν (on),
                    which is the present participle of the verb εἶναι (einai),
                    meaning "to be". The genitive form is ὄντος (ontos), meaning
                    "of being" or "of that which is."


                    The second part, "-logy", comes from the Greek -λογία
                    (-logia), which means "the study of," "discourse," or
                    "science." This suffix is derived from the word λόγος
                    (logos), meaning "word," "reason," or "speech."


                    Combined, the original language breakdown of ontology
                    literally means "the study of being" or "the science of
                    existence."
